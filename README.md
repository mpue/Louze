Louze
==============================

Louze is a very simple attempt to implement a chess client for Gnuchess in Java.

It provides a simple interface which can be controlled with the mouse and
some basic movement rules. It it still in very early stage and some rules 
like a rochade are still not implemented yet.

Usage
==============================
There is still no build script at the moment so you have to run and export the program 
from within eclipse. The main class is de.pueski.louze.app.Louze

In order to play you must have Gnuchess installed. The game is intended to run under Linux at the moment
but it should work under Windows with Cygwin and Gnuchess installed.
